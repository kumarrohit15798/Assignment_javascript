// There is a class of questions that pretty much always gets down voted or blocked, 
// which is architectureal design questions. I actually like the architectural design questions. 
// There is a lot of insight to be gained in computer science by understaing those. Ivan is asking a pretty basic question, 
// but it gets to a discussion of origin 1 vs 0 array addressing, as well as folding error codes into results. 
// I think Stephen Rauch blocked this to limit the obvious answers. FORTRAN, 
// PASCAL, and Lua were 1 origin but newer languages like C, python, and Javascript tend to 0 origin
